# marweni-os
Just my version of a [Debian live-build](https://live-team.pages.debian.net/live-manual/html/live-manual/index.en.html) with a backport kernel and btrfs, based on the official packages of the latest [current-live](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/).

## Acknowledgment
My motivation to try something like this comes from the [SpiralLinux project](https://spirallinux.github.io/), through which I learned a lot about live-build.
